# Cisco Edition

This is a modified version of [https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks] to include a cisco.toml configuration file that includes Cisco-specific patterns.  To use these patterns, you must include a `--config=examples/cisco.toml` option.


### [Gitleaks Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gitleaks) now available for your workflows!


Audit git repos for secrets. Gitleaks provides a way for you to find unencrypted secrets and other unwanted data types in git repositories. As part of its core functionality, it provides:

* Audits for uncommitted changes
* Github and Gitlab support including support for bulk organization and repository owner (user) repository scans, as well as pull/merge request scanning for use in common CI workflows.
* Support for private repository scans, and repositories that require key based authentication
* Output in JSON formats for consumption in other reporting tools and frameworks
* Externalised configuration for environment specific customisation including regex rules
* High performance through the use of src-d's [go-git](https://github.com/src-d/go-git) framework

### Docker usage examples

Run gitleaks against:

###### Public repository

```bash
docker run --rm --name=gitleaks zricethezav/gitleaks -v -r https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks.git
```

###### Local repository already cloned into /tmp/

```bash
docker run --rm --name=gitleaks -v /tmp/:/code/ zricethezav/gitleaks -v --repo-path=/code/gitleaks
```

By default repos cloned to memory. Using `--disk` for clone to disk or you can quickly out of memory.

For speed up analyze operation using `--threads` parameter, which set to `ALL - 1` threads at your instance CPU.

1: leaks present
2: error encountered
```
